# Data Engineering Project: Redfin Data Pipeline 

## Project Description:

The Redfin Real Estate Data Analytics project involves the usage of Python to design and implement an ETL data pipeline to extract real estate data from Redfin's data centre. The extracted data will then be transformed using Pandas, and the raw and transformed data will be loaded into Amazon S3 buckets. 
Once the transformed data lands in the S3 bucket, Snowpipe will automatically load it into a Snowflake data warehouse table. Finally, the data will be visualized in Power BI to gain valuable insights and inform business decisions. This project aims to create a seamless data flow from extraction to visualization, leveraging cloud-based technologies to drive real estate data analytics.

## Tech Stack

The following tech stack was used:

- Python
- AWS S3
- Apache Airflow
- Snowflake 
- Power BI
